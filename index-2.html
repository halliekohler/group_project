						<h2>What is Ebola virus disease?</h2>
						<p>Ebola virus disease (formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever) is a severe, often fatal illness, with a death rate of up to 90% caused by Ebola virus, a member of the filovirus family.</p>
						<p>The Ebola virus was first identified in 1976 when 2 simultaneous outbreaks occurred, 1 in Yambuku, a village not far from the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the other in a remote area of Sudan.</p>
						<p>The origin of the virus is unknown, but current evidence suggests that fruit bats (Pteropodidae) may be a host.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="faqcontent">
						<h2>Who is most at risk?</h2>
						<p>During an outbreak, those at higher risk of infection are health workers, family members or others in close contact with infected people, mourners who have direct contact with bodies during burial rituals.<p>
					</div>

					<div class="faqcontent">
						<h2>Why are mourners at burial ceremonies considered at risk of contracting Ebola?</h2>
						<p>Levels of Ebola virus remain high after death, thus bodies of those who have died from Ebola virus disease must be handled only by people wearing appropriate personal protective equipment and must be buried immediately. WHO advises that bodies of people who may have died from Ebola virus disease should be handled only by trained burial teams, who are equipped to properly bury the dead, safely and with dignity.</p>

					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="faqrightcol">
					<div class="faqcontent">
						<h2>Why are health-care workers at greater risk of catching Ebola?</h2>
						<p>Health-care workers are at greater risk of infection if they are not wearing correct personal protective equipment (PPE) or are not applying infection prevention and control (IPC) measures when caring for patients. All health-care providers working at all levels of the health system – hospitals, clinics and health posts – should be fully informed about the disease and its mode of transmission and should follow recommended precautions strictly.

					</div>

					<div class="faqcontent">
						<h2>Can Ebola be transmitted sexually?</h2>
						<p>Sexual transmission of the Ebola virus, from males to females, is a strong possibility, but has not yet been proven. Less probable, but theoretically possible, is female to male transmission.</p>

						<p>Studies have shown that Ebola virus can be isolated from semen up to 82 days after symptom onset and a recent case investigation identified genetic material from the virus 199 days after symptom onset. WHO has issued interim advice on sexual transmission of Ebola virus, available at: <a href="http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/rtis/ebola-virus-semen/en/)">Interim advice on the sexual transmission of the Ebola virus disease</a></p>
					</div>

					<div class="faqcontent">
						<h2>What are the typical signs and symptoms of Ebola virus infection?</h2>
						<p>Ebola symptoms vary but sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat are commonly experienced at the beginning of the disease (‘the dry phase’). As the disease progresses, people commonly develop vomiting and diarrhoea (‘the wet phase’), rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding.</p>
